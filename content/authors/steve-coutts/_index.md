I've spent the last few years delving into the intersection of cities, data and technology. My interest is in building human-centred alternatives to corporate-driven digital capitalism. My [master's research project](https://digital.library.ryerson.ca/islandora/object/RULA%3A7735), supervised by [Dr. Pamela Robinson](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=U5H2bdUAAAAJ&hl=en), focused on the role of urban planners in creating more open and inclusive smart cities.
